# Board-ready growth checklist

Before your next board update, make sure the following elements are aligned:

1. Market narrative and competitive position are current.
2. Pipeline and revenue signals are tied to measurable outcomes.
3. Product and go-to-market milestones are sequenced for the next two quarters.
4. Risks and operational dependencies are clearly articulated.

Use this checklist to guide confident leadership conversations.
